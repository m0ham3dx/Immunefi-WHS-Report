This section will be regarding my general approach and related matters. 

> ðŸ‘‰ I have made some mention of some tool which I have used.They are purely my personal choices.

# ðŸ§¡ Game Plan 

When I came into the `web3` security space, I was already researching this area with the plan of doing a startup. So I was constantly familiarizing myself with *blockchain* technologies and focussing on the development aspect. Prior to that I was what you call a "security enthusiast" in the web2 (traditional centralized computing) domain. 

The `web3` space during that period was under constant exploitation, with astronomical sums being [lost.](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) This was the impetus that led me down this rabbit hole.

	D --> d1(Attempts on programs <br> To be documented)

```

The above map was my own take on this matter after researching several learning paths. The good news was that the area of `web3 Security` was already heavily under investigation. This led to a wide variety of information which was available online. My primary research reference was [w3bs3c - Compilation of Web3 Security](https://www.w3bs3c.com/). 


# ðŸ§¡ Constantly Evolving Methodology 

The following methodology was arrived at after researching existing `web2` & `web3` methodologies.

```
The summary of the above diagram is as follows :

1. **Phase 1 - Recon** - Which means gathering information about your target, this phase is considered to be the most important phase in this process, poor recon leads to inability to identify bugs. 

2. **Phase 2 - Automated Testing** - This is often used for *baselining*. Usually most projects already use automated testing in their testing pipelines. However as the code base gets constantly updated, the <u>probability</u> of logical errors go up, and <i>automated tooling</i> is a fast way (albeit not the most precise way, due to the presence of false positives).
 
 1. **Phase 3 - Exploitable Functions** - This step involves functions that are prone to being exploited , some eg: of arbitray functions - 
    1. `depositFunds()` - Crypto IN
    2. `withdrawFunds()` - Crypto OUT
   

> ðŸ‘‰ [Smart Contract Weakness Classification Registry (SCWCR)](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry) - A repository of known vulnerability issues in Ethereum - Not updated regularly.

4. **Phase 4 - Threat Modelling** - Once vulnerable code has been identified, the next step is to assess the risk of those functions in simulated conditions. As a good starting point, it was recommended to read about past attacks via bug repots such as those listed in the [Immunefi Blog](https://medium.com/immunefi), that give technical details on how the exploit occurred.

5. **Phase 5 - Fuzzing** - Accomplished by tooling that can rapidly input a wide range of inputs to assess the behavior of a function. *Note - This step is not necessarily agreed upon, but in my opinion is a fast way to assess the risk of a bug which has been identified.*

6. **Phase 6 - POC** - A critical step in making the project understand the impact of the finding. This step is often overlooked either due to negligence or <u>lack of technical ability</u>, to write a great **POC**. The latter issue can be rectified by learning how existing POC's for findings have been written. This step is crucial in determining a **payout.**

## Map Core Camponents 

1. **Language Upskilling** - The most commonly used development languages are :
 
   1. [Solidity- Target -> EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/) - The large number of projects all are on the [Ethereum Chain.](https://ethereum.org/en/) 
   
   2. [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) -> [Solana](https://solana.com/nl/developers)/[Near](https://near.org/developers/) - Rust in addition to being a popular language for general development, since it is the closest to the `C` language, is also used for blockchain apps development.
   
   3. Javascript - Solidity is close to `javascript` and tests written for solidity dapps are in `javascript` which are used by the [Hardhat - Popular Development Environment for Dapp Development](https://hardhat.org/). However at the time of writing this report, there is a much faster Solidity Development Environment which has been written entirely in rust from the ground up. Its name is [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), one big advantage of this tool is that all the *test* are written in solidity
   
   4. Pythonic Languages - [Vyper](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) , [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) & [Apeworks](https://www.apeworx.io/) are all pythonic languages, which are used for dapp development and testing. Perfect for all the <u><i>pythonista's.</u></i>

2. **Tooling** - There are are variety of tools that make the testing of smart contract code a whole lot easier. They can be grouped into the following categories. Some tools have multiple functions. These are just the ones which I use and/or have come across.
   1. Transactions Analyzers
      1. [Eththx Transaction Decoders](https://ethtx.info/)
      2. [Tenderly Dashboard](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer?utm_source=homepage)
      3. [Dedaub](https://www.dedaub.com/)
   2. Automated Exploit Scanners
      1. [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither)
      2. [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)
   3. Fast Development Environments 
      1. [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)
      2. [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
   4. Fuzzers
      1. [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna)
      2. [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs)

3. CTF's - There exists a variety of [CTF's](https://www.w3bs3c.com/ctfs) for `web3`. I am actively attempting on some of them [HERE.](https://github.com/m0ham3dx/mxweb3ctfs)

> ðŸ‘‰ As of writing this report there is a  second version of the famous `Paradigm CTF`, which is scheduled between `2022-08-20T00:00:00.000Z ` to `2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z ` [HERE.](https://ctf.paradigm.xyz/)
