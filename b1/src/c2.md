This section will be regarding my general approach and related matters. 

> ðŸ‘‰ I have made some mention of the various tooling which are in use. These however can be considered adequate, they are purely my personal choices

# ðŸ§¡ Game Plan 

When I came into the `web3` security space, I was already researching this area with the plan of doing a startup. So I was constantly familiarizing myself with *blockchain* technologies and focussing on the devleopment aspect. Prior to that I was what you call a "security enthusiast" in the web2 (traditional centralized computing) domain. 

The `web3` space during that period was under constant exploitation, with astronomical sums being [lost.](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/) This was the impetus that led me down this rabbit hole

```

The above map was my own take on this matter after researching several learning paths. The good news was that the area of `web3 Security` was already heavily under investigation. This led to a wide variety of information which was available online. My primary research reference was [w3bs3c - Compilation of Web3 Security](https://www.w3bs3c.com/). 


# ðŸ§¡ Constantly Evolving Methodology 

The following methodology was arrived at after researching existing `web2` & `web3` methodologies. They are derived from documentation detailed practical debugging or code.

The summary of the above diagram is as follows 

1. **Phase 1** - Recon - Which means gathering information about your target, this phase is considered to be the most important phase in this process, poor recon leads to inability of identify bugs. 

2. **Phase 2** - Automated Testing - This is often used for baselining. Usually most projects already use automated testing in their testine pipelines. However as the code base gets constantly updated, the <u>probability</u> of logical errors go up, and <i>automated tooling</i> is a fast way (albeit not the most precise way, due to the presence of false positives).
